Ransomware Simulator: ransom.py
üîê Overview
This script demonstrates basic ransomware functionality by encrypting and decrypting files and folders using a password-based key derivation system.

üöÄ Features
Encrypt Files/Folders: Securely encrypt individual files or entire directories.
Decrypt Files/Folders: Decrypt encrypted files and directories with the correct password.
Password-Based Key Derivation: Uses Scrypt for deriving cryptographic keys.
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
Use this script with caution. It is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only. Never use it for malicious purposes. Ensure you understand the implications of encrypting and decrypting files before running the script.

üíª Getting Started
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/zigzag43/cybersec.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd cybersec
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install cryptography
üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Run the script with the following commands:

Encrypt a file or folder:

bash
Copy code
python ransom.py path/to/file_or_folder -e
Decrypt a file or folder:

bash
Copy code
python ransom.py path/to/file_or_folder -d
üîß Suggestions for Improvement
To enhance the script, consider adding a feature to automatically encrypt files upon opening them. This can be achieved by integrating a file system watcher or a command that encrypts files after they are accessed.
